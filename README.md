# react-calendar-component

Calendar Component [Demo](https://dakebl.github.io/react-calendar-component/)

**Notes:**
- I had to switch out the BrowserRouter for a HashRouter in order to host the component demo on github pages
- I have commented out some of the tests that cover interactivity. This is due to a scoping issue that I need to look into some more.
